Cold the night
Visions of past looking shine and bright
Moments whispered by the time already gone
I wonder why
Here aside I still feel your touch
Warm with shivering eyes
Sand is flowing through my hands
To hit land on I cry
Oh, I wish I could be with you one last time

Cold is the night on unbroken lies told
To carry on with hollow heart shown
Cold is the night on unbroken lies told
To carry on with hollow heart shown
Numb and cold

Cold the night
Scarlet the sky
Silence shouts your name out
Rain & Tears on these lines
Engraved in stone & my heart
I go back
To those days feeding my soul with your grace
"Do you remember as well...?"
Holding myself to your grave

You promised once
Nothing will set us apart
Oh, I wish I could dance
With you one last time

Cold is the night on unbroken lies told
To carry on with hollow heart shown
Cold is the night on unbroken lies told
To carry on with hollow heart shown
Numb and cold
