Running out of time, baby help me
I'm bringing down my own walls, I'm talking ectasy
Let's bring a little jealousy into it
Running out of line, baby tell me
Do you really wanna cross the rating
Or will you shy away from them

The whole town's walking in, just to face his fucking lies
Let the ceremony begin, let the pastor get behind
On the curb for me
On the curb for me
I can smell it in the air, got it written on the walls
Heard you came to say your prayers, in these godforsaken halls
Put your name on it
Put your name on it

I can't reach for a star with your name on it
Can you hear the hangman calling
I can't reach for a star with your name on it
So watch me bring the palisades down, you
You say you're on the way to the top
I said I'll leave the ledger hanging on me, by the spot
So whether you will leave it in the registry, or not
I'm not the one the feds will call, interrogating
You can get a little or a lot
But even with a little, you can make it out the spot
You've got to make a change, got to make it out the mud
So they can't utilize the tricks, they're keeping up and orchestrating
I see a man tryna preach
But will anyone listen for the things he teaches
Cause it's all the things I've heard before
I guess I better take a seat
Cause now and then I feel like, watching you dancing for me
So get acquainted
I can't reach for a star with your name on it
Get acquainted with the man of the hells
Can you hear the hangman calling
I can't reach for a star with your name on it
Get acquainted
So watch me bring the palisades down, you
Get acquainted with the devil

The whole town's walking in, just to face his fucking lies
Let the ceremony begin, let the pastor get behind
On the curb for me
On the curb for me
I can smell it in the air, got it written on the walls
Heard you came to say your prayers, in these godforsaken halls
Put your name on it
Put your name on it
